# Development Progress Report

## What was attempted:
1. Created the landing page header component with mobile-first responsive design
2. Implemented the component structure with:
   - Main header and subheader
   - Read/Write buttons with primary/secondary styling
   - Responsive layout
   - Image placeholder section
3. Updated the main page to use the new component
4. Attempted to resolve TypeScript configuration:
   - Created next-env.d.ts file
   - Verified tsconfig.json settings
   - Added proper type imports
   - Updated component to use React.FC type

## Current Issues:
1. TypeScript Configuration:
   - TypeScript is not recognizing installed type definitions
   - Module resolution errors for next/link and next/image
   - JSX element type issues
   - Despite having all necessary dependencies in package.json

2. Environment Setup:
   - No package manager (npm/yarn) available
   - Cannot run npm/yarn commands to verify installation
   - Cannot rebuild node_modules if needed

## Blocking Issues:
The main blocking issue is that TypeScript is not recognizing the installed type definitions, despite having:
1. All necessary dependencies in package.json
2. Proper TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
3. Next.js type declarations in next-env.d.ts

Without proper type resolution:
1. We cannot verify the component's type safety
2. We cannot proceed with testing
3. We cannot ensure the component will work as expected

## Next Steps Required:
1. Need proper environment setup with:
   - Access to package management tools
   - Ability to rebuild node_modules
   - Proper TypeScript configuration
2. Need to verify type definitions are properly installed
3. Need to test the component in a proper development environment

Without these prerequisites, we cannot proceed with the implementation in a type-safe manner.
