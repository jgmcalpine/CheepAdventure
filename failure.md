# Development Progress Report

## What was attempted:
1. Created the landing page header component with mobile-first responsive design
2. Implemented the component structure with:
   - Main header and subheader
   - Read/Write buttons with primary/secondary styling
   - Responsive layout
   - Image placeholder section
3. Updated the main page to use the new component

## Current Issues:
1. Environment Setup Issues:
   - No package manager (npm/yarn) available in the environment
   - Unable to install necessary type definitions
   - TypeScript configuration needs adjustment

2. TypeScript/Linter Errors:
   - Cannot find module 'next/link' and 'next/image'
   - JSX element type issues
   - Missing type declarations

## Next Steps Required:
1. Environment Setup:
   - Need access to package manager (npm/yarn)
   - Need to install required type definitions
   - Need to verify TypeScript configuration

2. Component Completion:
   - Need to create and add the adventure illustration
   - Need to test responsive layout
   - Need to add any necessary animations

## Blocking Issues:
The main blocking issue is the lack of package management tools in the environment, which prevents us from:
1. Installing necessary type definitions
2. Resolving TypeScript configuration issues
3. Testing the component in a proper development environment

Without these tools, we cannot properly complete the implementation and resolve the TypeScript errors.
