# React / Next.js Patterns

- Functional components only; no classes.
- Default to server components; use `"use client"` only when necessary.
- PascalCase component filenames inside `/components`.
- Destructure props; define `type Props = {}` explicitly.
- Co-locate components, minimal styles, and tests together.
- Avoid prop drilling; prefer context or render props.
- Use `React.lazy` for client-only heavy components.
