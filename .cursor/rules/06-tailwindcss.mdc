# TailwindCSS Guidelines

- Favor utility classes directly in JSX for rapid composition.
- Extract into `@apply` or components after 3+ repetitions.
- Keep `className` strings ≤ 120 chars; break across lines if longer.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
