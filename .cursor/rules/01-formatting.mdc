# Formatting Rules

- Indent with hard tabs (`\t`). Configure Prettier: `"useTabs": true`.
- Line length ≤ 100 chars; wrap longer JSX props vertically.
- Always end statements with semi‑colons.
- Use single quotes for TS/JS; double quotes for JSON and HTML attributes.
- Trailing commas where valid in ES5.
- Sort object keys when it improves diff‑clarity; otherwise preserve intention.
