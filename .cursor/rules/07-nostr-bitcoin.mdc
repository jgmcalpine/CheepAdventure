# Nostr / Bitcoin Specifics

- Use **NDK** exclusively for Nostr relay interactions.
- Generate Lightning invoices via `@/lib/lnurl.ts#createInvoice`.
- Store connected user pubkey in `AuthContext`; never global mutable vars.
- Handle payments with optimistic UI, then confirm with WebSocket or Nip-04 DM.
